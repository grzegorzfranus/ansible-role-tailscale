# =============================================================================
# Tailscale RSyslog Configuration
# =============================================================================
# This configuration file sets up specialized logging for Tailscale service.
# It configures rsyslog to:
#
# 1. Capture all log messages from the tailscaled program
# 2. Redirect them to a dedicated log file for easier monitoring and analysis
# 3. Stop processing these messages to avoid duplicate logging in syslog
#
# The 'stop' directive prevents further processing, so Tailscale logs won't 
# appear in the main system log file, reducing clutter.
# =============================================================================

# Redirect Tailscale logs to dedicated file
# Match logs by program name and redirect to the specified log file
:programname, isequal, "{{ tailscale_syslog_identifier }}" {{ tailscale_log_file }}

# Stop processing these logs further to prevent duplication
& stop
